			<h1>Lines and Edges</h1>
			<div class="author-wrapper">
				<p>By Bryan Sturm, with help from friends.</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				For anyone else out there struggling with anime-style art, this is what helped me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most anime "line drawings" are not actually line drawings. They are actually the boundaries of color shapes on
				the canvas.
			</p>
			<p>
				The easiest way to explain this is by drawing a distinction between <em>lines</em> and <em>edges</em>.
			</p>

			<!-- Lines -->

			<h2 id="lines">Lines</h2>
			<p>
				Conceptually, a <dfn>line</dfn> is a standalone graphic element. It has properties such as weight, length,
				direction, and speed.
			</p>
			<img src="lines.jpg" alt="Figure showing properties of lines." title="Different properties of lines.">
			<p>
				We use these properties to express how we <em>feel</em> about our subject. For example...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If we feel a particular feature is important, we can thicken our stroke weight to emphasize this importance.
				</li>
				<li>
					If we feel a set of features read as one connected thought, we can combine them together by using a single
					long stroke.
				</li>
				<li>
					If we feel a particular feature moves in a certain direction, we can align our stroke directions along the
					direction of movement.
				</li>
				<li>
					If we feel a certain tempo while passing through a feature, we can adjust our stroke speed to match the
					pacing.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Lines represent complete thoughts.
			</p>
			<img src="line-drawing.jpg" alt="A line drawing of a reversed dolphin mermaid." title="A standalone element.">
			<p>
				We do not need to add colors or shading to finish the illustration. Lines can stand on their own as a graphic
				element.
			</p>

			<!-- Edges -->

			<h2 id="edges">Edges</h2>
			<p>
				On the other hand, an <dfn>edge</dfn> represents the boundary between two different shapes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The easiest way to understand edges is by using the analogy of fences.
			</p>
			<img src="fence.jpg" alt="A figure showing a simple picket fence." title="Fences are boundaries.">
			<p>
				Like fences, edges separate two different regions of space. This leads to some interesting characteristics.
			</p>
			<p>
				For one, the only property edges have is hardness. When two shapes immediately transition, the edge is hard.
				When two gradients gradually mix together, the edge is soft.
			</p>
			<img src="edges.jpg" alt="Figure comparing hard and soft edges." title="Hard vs soft edges.">
			<p>
				Likewise, edges can only exist in the presence of shapes. That's because edges are a property of shapes. If you
				delete the shape, the edge disappears with it.
			</p>
			<img src="edges2.jpg" alt="Figure showing relationship of edges to shapes."
				title="Edges are a property of shapes.">
			<p>
				Where this distinction between lines and edges becomes muddled is once these two concepts hit the canvas. We
				usually draw both lines and edges using the same technique: a thin elongated mark. This unfortunate coincidence
				can make it difficult for an untrained eye to tell the difference.
			</p>
			<img src="muddle.jpg" alt="An annotated illustration identifying edges versus lines"
				title="Examples of lines vs edges.">
			<p>
				One easy way to determine whether something is a line or an edge is to ask yourself the question: <q>Could I
					change the width of this line without losing any information?</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Edges are the boundaries between shapes. No matter how wide or thin the mark is, the conceptual division between
				two distinct shapes remains the same. Mark width is irrelevant for edges.
			</p>
			<p>
				Line are different. If we change the width of the line, we fundamentally alter its meaning. Lines represent
				thoughts, and when we alter the line, we alter the thought.
			</p>

			<!-- Sketching -->

			<h2 id="sketching-with-edges">Sketching with Edges</h2>
			<p>
				This brings us back to anime-style line art. Let us first break down how we can achieve a similar sketch style
				to Japanese anime artists.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first consequence of our understanding is this:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>An anime-style sketch uses no <em>lines</em>, only <em>edges</em>.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is an example of the difference between a drawing made with lines and a drawing made with edges.
			</p>
			<img src="sketch.jpg" alt="Lines vs edges.">
			<p>
				There are a couple things to take notice of here.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first observation is that many of the details inside the subject have been eliminated.
			</p>
			<img src="sketch-detail.jpg" alt="A close up showing the removal of curvature marking."
				title="Closeup of removed details.">
			<p>
				These quick repeating lines suggesting the curvature of the body have been omitted. These marks were not not
				necessary to illustrate the boundary between two shapes, so we left them out.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second observation is the mark width.
			</p>
			<img src="sketch-detail-2.jpg" alt="A close up comparing the mark width." title="Closeup of mark width.">
			<p>
				Notice how the edge drawing uses marks that are an order of magnitude thinner than the line drawing.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is where theory turns into practice.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is nearly impossible to achieve this level of precision by approaching the subject with the intent to draw
				lines. Our sense of intuition crumbles once our mark width drops beneath a certain threshold. And without our
				intuition, it is impossible to draw convincingly at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only way to surpass this limit is to tap into the brain's understanding of edges. Our intuition for the
				boundaries between shapes far exceeds our feel for form and rhythm.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once we start thinking in terms of boundaries, we can crank the mark width down as small as we like.
			</p>
			<img src="shrink.jpg" alt="A figure showing progressively thinner edges." title="Only the shape matters.">
			<p>
				Our lines might start to become a little wobbly, but that's fine. The mark itself is no longer important,
				only the shape it encloses.
			</p>

			<!-- Painting -->

			<h2 id="painting-with-edges">Painting with Edges</h2>
			<p>
				So far, we have only talked about black and white drawings. Now let's take a look at how our understanding of
				lines versus edges applies to painting.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second consequence of our understanding is this:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>A drawing that looks bad when colored is probably using a <em>line</em> where an <em>edge</em> was
					needed.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is an example of what usually happens when we try to color a <em>line</em> drawing instead of an
				<em>edge</em> drawing.
			</p>
			<img src="bad-line.jpg" alt="A comparison illustrating the jarring effect of coloring line drawings."
				title="Lines where edges were needed.">
			<p>
				While the line drawing on the left looks fine, the colored version on the right doesn't quite match up. The
				patches of color seem to fight the dark marks strewn around the canvas.
			</p>
			<p>
				This problem is symptomatic of most drawings that were originally conceived in terms of black and white lines.
			</p>
			<p>
				The way we can overcome this problem is by leveraging our knowledge of shapes and edges.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we want our drawing to look good when colored we need to starting thinking in terms of shapes <em>from the
					start.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				-- Can represent an edge any way we like.
			</p>
			<p>
				-- Can use lines occasionally, but only if it is a standalone element.
			</p>

			<!-- Closing Remarks -->

			<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A line is a standalone element with properties like weight and direction.</li>
				<li>An edge is a boundary between two different shapes.</li>
				<li>Lines make sense on their own.</li>
				<li>Edges only make sense in relationship to shapes.</li>
				<li>Anime-style sketches uses only edges.</li>
				<li>Partner edges with colors instead of lines with colors.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				In a pencil drawing, you only have lines. In an oil painting, you only have edges. In anime-style art, you
				juggle both lines and edges in the same composition.
			</p>
			<p>
				To master the anime style, you must master the difference between lines and edges. Once you do, it is one of the
				most fun and efficient styles out there!
			</p>

			<p>
				For those who like a visual summary, this diagram neatly sums up the main points.

			<section>
				<h3>Properties of Lines</h3>
				<p>
					Earlier, we observed that lines have properties such as weight and direction. What other properties do lines
					have that set them apart from edges?
				</p>

				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Color, rhythm, density, etc.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Representations of Edges</h3>
				<p>
					Can you use a thick line to represent an edge?
				</p>
				<p>
					How would you represent a soft edge?
				</p>

				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Since an edge has no width conceptually, any width line in any color can work.
					</p>
					<p>
						Either two lines, start and stop. Or draw with soft gradient.
