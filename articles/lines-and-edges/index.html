			<h1>Lines and Edges</h1>

			<p>
				For anyone else out there struggling with anime-style art, this is what helped me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most anime "line drawings" are not actually line drawings. What you're actually looking at are the boundaries of
				color shapes on the canvas.
			</p>
			<p>
				The easiest way to explain this is by drawing a distinction between <em>lines</em> and <em>edges</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conceptually, a <dfn>line</dfn> is a standalone graphic element. It has properties such as weight, direction,
				rhythm, and energy. Careful arrangement of lines yields a finished illustration.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, an <dfn>edge</dfn> represents the boundary between two different shapes. This leads to some
				interesting characteristics. For one, the only property edges have is hardness. When two shapes immediately
				transition, the edge is hard. When two gradients gradually mix together, the edge is soft. Likewise, edges can
				only exist in the presence of shapes. That's because edges are a property of shapes. If you delete the shape,
				the edge disappears with it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where this distinction becomes muddled is once these two concepts hit the canvas. Usually, lines and edges are
				drawn using the same technique: a thin contrasting line. This unfortunate coincidence can make it difficult for
				an untrained eye to tell the difference.
			</p>
			<p>
				This brings us back to anime-style line art.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first consequence of our understanding is this:
			</p>
			<p class="key-quote">
				An anime-style sketch uses no <em>lines</em>, only <em>edges</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is nearly impossible to achieve the same level of precision by approaching the subject with the intent to
				draw lines. Your sense of intuition crumbles once your line width drops beneath a certain threshold. And without
				your intuition, it is impossible to draw convincingly at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only way to surpass this limit is to tap into the brain's understanding of edges. Our feel for the
				boundaries between shapes far exceeds our feel for form and rhythm.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second consequence of our understanding is this:
			</p>
			<p class="key-quote">
				A drawing that looks bad when colored is probably using a <em>line</em> where an
				<em>edge</em> was needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a pencil drawing, you only have lines. In an oil painting, you only have edges. In anime-style art, you
				juggle both lines and edges in the same composition.
			</p>
			<p>
				To master the anime style, you must master the difference between lines and edges. Once you do, it is one of the
				most fun and efficient styles out there!

				<h3>Identifying Lines and Edges</h3>
				<p>
					Here is an image. Identify which elements are lines and which are edges.
				</p>

				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						TODO
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Properties of Lines</h3>
				<p>
					Earlier, we observed that lines have properties such as weight and direction. What other properties do lines
					have that set them apart from edges?
				</p>

				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Color, rhythm, density, etc.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Representations of Edges</h3>
				<p>
					Can you use a thick line to represent an edge?
				</p>
				<p>
					How would you represent a soft edge?
				</p>

				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Since an edge has no width conceptually, any width line in any color can work.
					</p>
					<p>
						Either two lines, start and stop. Or draw with soft gradient.
